# Fake News Detection
Fake news detection using BERT

## Requirements
- Python 3
- tensorflow-gpu==1.14
- bert-tensorflow

Do make sure you set it up correctly on your machine as I ran this notebook through [colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

## Setup

I am using the model [`BERT-Base, Uncased`](https://storage.googleapis.com/bert_models/2018_10_18/uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12.zip) as colab does not have enough vram to run a large model in my case.

You can go to [`BERT official github`](https://github.com/google-research/bert) for any references.

Dataset used is from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mohit28rawat/fake-news).
